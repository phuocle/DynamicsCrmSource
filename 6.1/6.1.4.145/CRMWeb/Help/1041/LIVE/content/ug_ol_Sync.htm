			<p class="bodyText">While you are online with Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Microsoft Office Outlook, changes you make to tracked records in Outlook or Microsoft Dynamics CRM are visible to others as soon as you save the record. Changes that others make to Microsoft Dynamics CRM are visible to you after they save the record. Changes that others make to records you are tracking in Outlook may not be visible in Outlook for up to 15 minutes. </p>
			<p class="bodyText">If you are working offline, your changes are kept in your local data, which was updated last when you went offline. When you go back online, your changes are made to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM server and are visible to everyone. </p>
			<p class="bodyText">The Microsoft Dynamics CRM address book is synchronized separately and on a different schedule.</p>

				<p class="bodyText">You can set your synchronization options so that incoming and outgoing Microsoft Dynamics CRM e-mail messages are recognized as an e-mail activity.</p>
				<p class="bodyText">Track e-mail messages, contacts, tasks, meetings, and appointments in Outlook to create a corresponding activity or contact record in Microsoft Dynamics CRM.  </p>
				<p class="bodyText">You can also link the items. To link a Outlook item to a Microsoft Dynamics CRM record, click or tap the <b>Set Regarding</b> or <b>Set Parent</b> button, and then select an account or contact. Clicking or tapping <b>Set Regarding</b> or <b>Set Parent</b> automatically tracks the record.</p>
				<p class="bodyText">Linking also tracks all replies to linked e-mail messages. Tracked e-mail messages, contacts, tasks, and appointments are updated to Microsoft Dynamics CRM immediately while you are online. If you are offline, these items are stored in your local data to be synchronized with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM server when you go back online.</p>
				<p class="bodyText">By default, tracked items display a <b>Tracked in CRM</b> icon <img src="trackincrm.gif" title="trackincrm" /> rather than the standard Outlook symbols for e-mail messages, contacts, and tasks. </p>
				<p class="bodyText">More information: <b>Automatically track and save incoming Outlook e-mail as Microsoft Dynamics CRM e-mail activities</b></p>
				<p class="bodyText">You can choose to automatically create Microsoft Dynamics CRM contact or lead records from the sender of tracked e-mail messages and the organizer of tracked meetings when you are online. </p>
				<p class="bodyText">While you are offline, contact and lead records are not created automatically from tracked e-mail messages or the organizer of tracked meetings. You must manually create the records.</p>

				<p class="bodyText">To use Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Microsoft Office Outlook, you must sign in with your credentials (an email address and password). You may choose to save this information locally so that you aren't asked for your credentials each time you open Microsoft Outlook. If you choose to save this information, CRM for Outlook will automatically connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM every time you open Outlook.<br /> After the first time you sign in and use CRM for Outlook, the connection between your computer and CRM will always be open when you have access to the Internet. You may choose to turn off the connection between your computer and CRM through the Options area. If you choose to clear this option, CRM for Outlook may suffer from decreased performance.<br /> You can use CRM for Outlook to track email in CRM. If you do, the email thread will be visible to the users in your organization who have permission to view it.<br /> For every email you receive, CRM for Outlook will send CRM the sender's email address, the recipient's email address, and the subject line of the message. This enables CRM to validate whether any particular mail should be stored by the CRM service. When an item is tracked, a copy of that item will be maintained by the CRM service and will be visible to the other users in your organization who have the right permissions. When an item is untracked, that copy is automatically deleted from the CRM service only if that item is owned by you.<br /></p>
