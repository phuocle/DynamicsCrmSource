			<p class="bodyText">Enable Activity Feeds to let users see their most recent activities on the wall. When you first install Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Activity Feeds is available and turned on by default, though it is a solution and you'll administer it as you would any other solution.</p>
			<p class="bodyText">Your organization also can use Yammer, which is an alternative to using activity feeds—you can use either one, but not both.</p>
			<p class="bodyText">Many record types allow for activities to be associated with them. For example, for an opportunity, you might have an associated phone call activity. If you want to stay up to date with what's happening in your organization, viewing all the activities you and your colleagues have recorded in the system is an effective way to do that. With activity feeds, you'll see the most recent news about everything you're interested in—colleagues and records alike—in one single-page view.</p>
			<p class="bodyText">You can do the following in Activity Feeds: </p>
			<ul class="bulletedlist">
				<li class="bulletedlistitem">
					<p class="bodyText">Create a personal page. Here, you can post a profile picture along with other personal data about you and the work you do.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bulletedlistitem">
					<p class="bodyText">View recent news in one view. On your personal page, you'll see a feed of updates from colleagues as well as updates about records.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bulletedlistitem">
					<p class="bodyText">Follow your colleagues. When a colleague you follow posts a comment, you'll see it on your feed page. If the colleague changes a record, you'll see that on your feed page as well.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bulletedlistitem">
					<p class="bodyText">Follow records. You can stay up to date on records by following them in activity feeds. Even if you're not following the user who changes them, your feed page will display posts about opportunities, leads, and cases that you follow.</p>
