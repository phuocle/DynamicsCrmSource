			<h2 class="heading2">Lesson 1: Create a new campaign response manually</h2>
			<div class="l2">
				<p class="bodyText">You can create responses manually by creating a campaign activity and then converting it, or by creating a new campaign response in a <b>Campaign</b> form.</p>
				<p class="bodyText">For example, when your company launches a new product, you may set up a campaign from start to finish in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. You may set up a booth at the county fair to promote this product and use a printed sign-up sheet on a clipboard to collect contact information from people who are interested in learning more about your product. You can add each of these potential customers as a campaign response activity associated with the campaign activity for the event in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. </p>
				<p class="bodyText">Only the following activities can be converted to campaign responses:</p>
				<ul class="bulletedlist">
					<li class="bulletedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Appointment</b>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bulletedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>E-mail</b>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bulletedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Fax</b>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bulletedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Letter</b>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bulletedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Phone Call</b>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="bodyText">You can also open the campaign record for your product launch, and click <b>Campaign Responses</b> under <b>Common</b>, and then click <b>New</b> to create the campaign response in Microsoft Dynamics CRM and automatically associate it with the parent campaign.</p>

				<div id="dID0EBAEAA" class="expandedendtips" style="display: none">
					<p class="bodyText">Although you can create campaign responses manually in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, for situations where you receive contact information outside the system, you may want to consider entering the potential customers as leads instead. You can then convert these leads to opportunities. When you convert a lead to an opportunity, you can also record the fact that the opportunity was generated from a campaign response, as described in the next section. </p>

			<h2 class="heading2">Lesson 2: Convert an activity to a campaign response</h2>
			<div class="l2">
				<p class="bodyText">When someone responds to the marketing material you've sent, you can convert the corresponding campaign activity, such as a phone call, e-mail, or appointment, to a campaign response.</p>
				<p class="bodyText">For example, to help promote your new product to retailers, you create phone call activities that you distribute to your telesales representatives. One of the retailers on your call list responds favorably to your organization's offer. With the <b>Phone Call</b> activity form open, your telesales representative clicks <b>Promote to Response</b> in the <b>Convert Activity</b> group. Alternatively, the representative can also click <b>To Opportunity</b>, and then locate and select data for the <b>Customer</b> field and <b>Source Campaign</b> field. By default, the <b>Record a closed campaign response</b> option is selected, which will automatically generate a campaign response and associate it to the campaign in Microsoft Dynamics CRM.</p>
				<p class="bodyText" />
			</div>
			<a name="a56325" />
			<h2 class="heading2">Lesson 3: Automate creating campaign responses</h2>
			<div class="l2">
				<p class="bodyText">For e-mail activities included in your campaign, you can have Microsoft Dynamics CRM create the corresponding campaign response records automatically when customers respond to these activities.</p>
				<p class="bodyText">For example, from a campaign record, you create a campaign activity and choose e-mail as the channel. Because you created the activity from within the campaign record, the e-mail activity is automatically associated with the marketing campaign. After selecting a marketing list, distribute the activity. Microsoft Dynamics CRM then creates individual e-mail activities with the <b>Regarding</b> field pointing to the <b>Subject</b> field of the <b>Campaign Activity</b> form. If the recipient sends an e-mail back to your organization, Microsoft Dynamics CRM tries to match the incoming message with the e-mail activities based on information in the e-mail subject line. If Microsoft Dynamics CRM finds a match, it creates a corresponding campaign response activity.</p>
				<div class="alertContent">
					<p class="importanthead">Important </p>
					<p class="bodyText">This option is available only if the <b>Track e-mails sent between CRM users as two activities</b> and <b>Create campaign responses for incoming e-mail</b> options are enabled in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. </p>
					<p class="bodyText">More information:  <a target="_blank" href="./help/ui_set_SystemSet_dlg_marketing.htm">Set System-Wide Marketing Options</a>,  <a target="_blank" href="./help/ui_set_SystemSet_dlg_email.htm">System Settings Dialog Box - E-mail</a><b /></p>

				<p class="bodyText" />
			</div>
			<a name="a56326" />
			<h2 class="heading2">Lesson 4: Import campaign responses</h2>
			<div class="l2">
				<p class="bodyText">You can capture records of responses received as part of campaign efforts performed outside Microsoft Dynamics CRM by importing the campaign responses. </p>
				<p class="bodyText">For example, to handle the temporary increase in call volume during the product launch, you may outsource some of this work to a vendor. You can have the vendor representatives add the responses received during the week to a file, and send the file to you. You can then import this file into Microsoft Dynamics CRM. When you import the file, Microsoft Dynamics CRM creates individual campaign responses and associates them with the campaign you specify.</p>
