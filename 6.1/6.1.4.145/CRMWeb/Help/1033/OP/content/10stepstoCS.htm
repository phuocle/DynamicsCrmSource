Review the tasks in this article to quickly get started with customer service in Microsoft Dynamics CRM.</p>

			<div class="l2">
				<ol class="numberlist">
					<li class="numberedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Find what's assigned to you</b>
						</p>
						<p class="bodyText">See your queue to know what you've got to work on. More information:  <a href="aboutqueues.htm">Find what's assigned to you by using queues</a></p>
					</li>
					<li class="numberedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Use activities to track work in cases</b>
						</p>
						<p class="bodyText">After you open a case, you can open activities, such as tasks, from the case record. When you close an activity and record the duration, it is added to the total billing time for the case. You can adjust the billing time as needed. All activities must be closed to resolve a case. When you resolve the case, the total is displayed. More information:  <a href="source_sr_add_activity_to_case.htm">Add a phone call, task, email or appointment to a record</a></p>
					</li>
					<li class="numberedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Assign and share records</b>
						</p>
						<p class="bodyText">What Microsoft Dynamics CRM customer information you can work with is determined by permissions and ownership. If more than one person needs to work with a record, it can be shared or assigned. When you share a record with another user, you give that user specific permissions for that record, but you retain the ownership. However, when you assign a record to another user, you are making that user the owner of the record. More information:  <a href="source_sr_assign_case_to_others.htm">Assign a case to others</a></p>
						<p class="bodyText">For cases, you can assign a case to a queue.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="numberedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Find information in articles in the knowledge base</b>
						</p>
						<p class="bodyText">The knowledge base is a collection of articles that can include procedures, answers to common questions, product sheets, problem solutions, or anything else your organization wants to share.</p>
						<p class="bodyText">You can search for an article by keyword, title, article, number, subject, or use a full-text search. More information:  <a href="aboutarticles.htm">Use articles in the knowledge base</a></p>
					</li>
					<li class="numberedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Resolve and reactivate a case</b>
						</p>
						<p class="bodyText">When a problem has been solved or addressed to the customer's satisfaction, you can resolve the case and record the resolution and the amount of time to be billed to the customer. </p>
						<p class="bodyText">Before a case can be resolved, all its activities must be closed. If the case is linked to a contract line, it must be active and have sufficient allotments to resolve the case. You can only resolve cases one at a time. More information:  <a href="source_sr_resolve_case.htm">Resolve or cancel a case</a></p>
					</li>
					<li class="numberedlistitem">
						<p class="bodyText">
							<b>Using reports to track your work</b>
						</p>
						<p class="bodyText">You can use reports to manage your work and identify trends and issues. Microsoft Dynamics CRM comes with some default reports. You can also create reports that meet you requirements. </p>
